## Breast Cancer

According to published statistics, breast cancer has become a major health problem in both developed and developing countries over the past 50 years, and its incidence has increased in recent years. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer in women, but early detection and treatment can considerably improve outcomes.
Breast cancer cells usually form a tumor that can often be seen on an x-ray or felt as a lump. Breast cancer occurs almost entirely in women, but men can get breast cancer, too. [Source](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/about/what-is-breast-cancer.html)
