## What Is Breast Cancer?

Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast. Cancer starts when cells begin to grow out of control. 
Breast cancer cells usually form a tumor that can often be seen on an x-ray or felt as a lump. Breast cancer occurs almost entirely in women, but men can get breast cancer, too. [Source](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/about/what-is-breast-cancer.html)

## About the notebook

Hello, in this notebook I'm going to show you how to use supervised learning in the task of identify if is a benign of maleficent breast cancer. Below, is shown the Data Science Process. It's based in it that i'm going to teach the step by step to reach the result.
